<p>This is the first in what may become a series of puzzles with a constraint I call lucky charms. This is based on one of my all time favorite sugary breakfast cereals from the US. This puzzle is rather easy but I hope that doesn't prevent you from enjoying it because I think you'll find that it has some really neat logic. If you like this variant, please let me know. </p>
<p>Ordinary sudoku rules apply. In addition, some cells are lucky charms. Each lucky charm symbol represents a different number. The digits near the lucky charm (adjacent and diagonally adjacent) that are within 1 of the lucky charm's number are called close neighbors. For example, if the lucky charm is 4, any neighboring digits that are 3, 4, or 5 are close neighbors. See the example below where these are highlighted. A lucky charm has exactly as many close neighbors as it's number. In the below example, there are two 3's, a 4, and a 5 for a total of 4 close neighbors.

All lucky charms are given (so negative constraints may be necessary).
