<p>I've always wanted to create a puzzle that makes heavy use of negative constraints. Let me know what you think of this puzzle. It might be an acquired taste.</p>
<p>
Ordinary Sudoku Rules Apply. Additionally:
</p>
<p>
1. Cells that appear in the same position relative to their box form a set of the digits 1 through 9 (Disjoint Groups)
</p>
<p>
2. The digits 1 through 9 appear on each diagonal exactly once each
</p>
<p>
3. Digits separated by a black dot have a ratio of 1 to 2
</p>
<p>
4. Digits separated by a white dot are consecutive
</p>
<p>
All such dots are given! 
</p>
<p>That's it! Enjoy! :)
