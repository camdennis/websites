<p>As I always say, it's been a while since I've made a puzzle. Here's a fun little one. I hope you enjoy.</p>
<p>
Ordinary Sudoku Rules Apply
</p>
<p>
Additionally, cells that appear in the same position relative to their box form a set of the digits 1-9 (Disjoint Groups).
</p>
<p> Clues outside the grid give the sum of the digits along the indicated diagonal (digits may repeat if allowed by other rules).
</p>
<p> The digits along an arrow sum to the value in the arrow's circle.
</p>
<p>That's it! Enjoy! :)
