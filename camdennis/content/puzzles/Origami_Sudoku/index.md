<p>I had an unsolved 1 star sudoku puzzle that I accidentally left folded up on my desk. I asked someone to scan it and email it to me but they didn't unfold it before doing so! Can you still solve this 1 star puzzle?</p>
<p>
-Ordinary sudoku rules apply
</p>
<p>
-Note that the 3 and 8 are symmetric across the horizontal axis
</p>
<p>
-Note that you can't actually tell which number is on top of a pile
</p>
<p>
To make things easier, here is how I folded the puzzle

<p>Here is the puzzle as well as a sample of my handwriting. Enjoy! :)
