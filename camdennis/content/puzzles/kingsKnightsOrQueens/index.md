Try it EITHER as King Sudoku (identical digits cannot be a chess king's move apart) OR Queen Sudoku (9s cannot be a chess queen's move apart) OR Knight Sudoku (identical digits cannot be a knight's move apart)

NOTE: Because this puzzle has multiple solutions, the answer check function will not work.
