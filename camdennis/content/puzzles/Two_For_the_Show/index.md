<p>I've had this break-in idea for a while now. This is just a fun little puzzle. Nothing too extreme.</p>
<p>
Ordinary Sudoku Rules Apply. Additionally:
</p>
<p>
1. Arrow rules apply: Digits along an arrow sum to the digit in the arrow's circle.
</p>
<p>
2. Kropki Rules Apply: Digits separated by a black dot have a ratio of 1 to 2. Not all dots are necessarily given.
</p>
<p>
3. Killer Rules Apply: Digits in the box sum to 11.
</p>
<p>That's it! Enjoy! :)
