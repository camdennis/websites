<p>My previous puzzle with this theme seemed to go over pretty well, so I've made another. Again, this one is not too terribly difficult, but I think quite fun.</p>
<p>
-Ordinary sudoku rules apply.
</p>
<p>
-Thermometer rules apply. Digits must strictly increase along thermometers starting from the bulb end.
</p>
<p>
-Looking glass rules (new!) apply. Each digit (1-9) has a "buddy" that appears in all of the cells where the row and column indices are swapped. For example, if 1's are buddies with 4's and there is a 1 in r5c2, then there must be a 4 in r2c5. Ones being buddies with fours implies that fours are buddies with ones. It's possible for a number to be it's own buddy. Figuring out the buddies is part of the puzzle.
</p>
<p>
This is really a very simple rule, but if you are confused by my explanation or have clarifying questions, please let me know.
</p>
<p>Here is the puzzle. Enjoy! :)
