<p>Here's an easy little puzzle. I hope you enjoy.</p>
<p>
Ordinary Sudoku Rules Apply
</p>
<p>Cells along the main diagonal cannot repeat
</p>
<p>Cells in shaded boxes are even
</p>
<p>Digits on the thick lines form palindromes
</p>
<p>The sum of the digits along the indicated diagonals and in the outlined boxes have the same sum and this sum is greater than 30
</p>
<p>That's it! Enjoy! :)
