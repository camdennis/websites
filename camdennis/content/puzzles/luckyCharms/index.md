Rules:

-Ordinary sudoku rules apply.

-Lucky Charms Rules apply. Some cells are lucky charms. Each lucky charm symbol represents a different number. The digits near the lucky charm (adjacent and diagonally adjacent) that are within 1 of the lucky charm's number are called close neighbors. For example, if the lucky charm is 4, any neighboring digits that are 3, 4, or 5 are close neighbors. A lucky charm has exactly as many close neighbors as it's number. All lucky charms are given. (Remember that all lucky charms are given.)
