Rules:

-Ordinary sudoku rules apply.

-Klein Bottle Rules Apply. This puzzle takes place on a klein bottle. The top and bottom of the grid are glued together--they obey periodic boundary conditions. The left and right side are twisted and then glued together.

-Magic square rules apply. The pink cells represent the centers of 3x3 magic squares. A magic square is a square of unique digits (in this case 1 through 9) such that every row, column, and main diagonal have the same sum.
