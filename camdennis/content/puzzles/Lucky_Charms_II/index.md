<p>Just a little (kinda hard) puzzle to keep you entertained if you're experiencing ridiculous weather like I am.</p>
<p>
Ordinary Sudoku Rules Apply. Additionally:
</p>
<p>
1. Cells with gray boxes must contain even digits
</p>
<p>
2. Cells with the lucky charm symbol inside are lucky. The digit inside a lucky charm cell must have that many adjacent and diagonally adjacent neighbors within 1 of the digit. e.g. if a lucky charm cell contains an 8, all 8 of the surrounding cells must be 7, 8, or 9. If it contains a 4, then EXACTLY 4 of the surrounding cells must be 3, 4, or 5.
</p>
<p>That's it! Enjoy! :)
