<p>I was surprised and delighted when putting together this puzzle. I hope you will be surprised and delighted too!</p>
<p>
Ordinary Sudoku Rules Apply. Additionally:
</p>
<p>
1. Arrow rules apply: Digits along an arrow sum to the digit in the arrow's circle. Digits may repeat on arrows if allowed by other rules
</p>
<p>
2. Thermo Rules Apply: Digits along each thermometer must increase starting from the bulb end (and digits may not repeat along a thermometer).
</p>
<p>
3. Knights Move Rules Apply: Digits must not repeat in cells that are a chess knight's move apart.
</p>
<p>That's it! Enjoy! :)
