<p>Every puzzle I have posted so far has been an attempt at making inventive new variants. This is just a partial killer-little killer puzzle.</p>
<p>
-Ordinary sudoku rules apply
</p><p>-Partial killer rules apply (digits in cages cannot repeat and must sum to the total given by the cage)
</p><p>-Little Killer rules apply (digits outside the grid indicate the sum of the digits along the marked diagonal. Digits may repeat.
</p>
<p>Here is the puzzle. Enjoy! :)
