<p>As I always say, it's been a while since I've made a puzzle. Here's a fun little one. I hope you enjoy.</p>

In addition, a snake of orthogonally connected cells goes from the upper left green square to the bottom right green square. The snake cannot touch itself orthogonally, but can touch itself diagonally.
