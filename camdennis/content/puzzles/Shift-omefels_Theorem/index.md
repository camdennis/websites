<p>Here is a potentially easy puzzle. The intention is for you to use the shifted version of Phistomefel's theorem. @Narayana refers to Phistomefel's theorem as the Four Lines and Four Boxes theorem (FLFB) which I prefer as well. If you can figure out how to use this theorem, this puzzle is much simpler (as far as I can tell). However, it is almost certainly possible to solve this puzzle without the theorem!</p>
<p>
Here is an explanation image. The original theorem is shown where the numbers in the red regions are the same as the numbers in the blue region. However, one may shift the three leftmost columns to the right end of the puzzle to get a new theorem which still works. There are therefore several of these shifted theorems that may prove to be useful.

Please let me know if you figured this out with or without using this technique! For added cred, do it both ways ;)
