Rules:

-Ordinary sudoku rules DO NOT apply. Please read carefully.

-This puzzle takes place on a klein bottle. The top and bottom of the grid are glued together--they obey periodic boundary conditions. The left and right side are twisted and then glued together. The little klein bottles denote the separation of two horizontal 9 square "klein rows." Each column and box behave normally. Every column, box, and klein row must contain the digits 1-9 exactly once. You may notice that the 1's in the puzzle are in the same "ordinary row" but they are separated by a klein bottle and are therefore in different klein rows.
