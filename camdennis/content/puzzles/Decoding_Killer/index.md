<p>Here is another decoding puzzle. Before you begin, it's important to note that this type of puzzle requires a firm grasp of the English language. I sincerely apologize if this excludes you. I promise to make many more puzzles in the future that are more inclusive.

The killer cages are clues that are needed to solve the puzzle. Some (but not necessarily all) need to be decoded and then read from left to right and top to bottom.

To decode a clue, subtract 26 from it as many times as you can without it becoming negative and then convert that number to it's alphabetical character (1=a, 2=b, 3=c,...)

<p>Here is the puzzle. Enjoy! :)
