<p>Here is a very small and potentially very easy puzzle. The intention is for you to use the 8x8 version of Phistomefel's theorem. Which, as far as I know, is a novel concept. If you can do that, this puzzle is much simpler (as far as I can tell). However, it is almost certainly possible to solve this puzzle without the theorem!</p>
<p>
Here is an explanation image.



There are two version of Phistomefel's theorem that show up in this puzzle with non-square regions. In both sides of this image, the red and blue highlighted squares contain the same digits (red=blue). The proof for this follows from the original discovery. If you don't know what I'm talking about, see <a href="http://forum.logic-masters.de/showthread.php?tid=1811">here</a>.

Please let me know if you figured this out with or without using this technique! For added cred, do it both ways ;)
