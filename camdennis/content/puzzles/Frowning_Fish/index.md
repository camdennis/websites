<p>I've had this idea for a bit now and I finally got around to making the puzzle. I'm happy with it. Let me know what you think :)</p>
<p>
Ordinary Sudoku Rules Apply. In addition:
</p>
<p>
1. Little Killer Rules Apply: The arrows outside the grid show the sum of the digits along the indicated diagonal
</p>
<p>
2. Arrow Rules: Digits along an arrow sum to the value in the arrow circle
</p>
<p>
3. Palindrome Rules: Digits along the gray lines are palindromes reading the same forwards and backwards
</p>
<p>
4. Kropki Rules: Cells separated by a black dot have a ratio of 1:2 and cells separated by a white dot are consecutive. Not all dots are given.
</p>
<p>That's it! Enjoy! :)
