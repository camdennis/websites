<p>Just a little (kinda hard) puzzle to keep you entertained if you're experiencing ridiculous weather like I am.</p>
<p>
Ordinary Sudoku Rules Apply. Additionally:
</p>
<p>
1. Anti-Knight Rules Apply: Cells within a knights move of one another cannot contain the same digit
</p>
<p>

2. Renban Rules Apply: Cells on a magenta line must contain consecutive digits (in any order)
</p>
<p>

3. German Whisper Rules Apply: Adjacent digits on a green line must differ by at least 5
</p>
<p>That's it! Enjoy! :)
