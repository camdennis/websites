<p>I just sat down and made this. I've been working on something a little more fun, but wanted to play around in the meantime.</p>
<p>
Ordinary Sudoku Rules Apply. Additionally:
</p>
<p>
1. Arrow rules apply: Digits along an arrow sum to the digit in the arrow's circle.
</p>
<p>
2. Little Killer Rules Apply: Cells along the indicated diagonals sum to the given value.
</p>
<p>That's it! Enjoy! :)
