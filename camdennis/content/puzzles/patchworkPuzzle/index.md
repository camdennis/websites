The good news is that I cut all of my sudoku puzzles into jigsaw puzzles. The bad news is that I accidentally got them all mixed up. Here are nine pieces from nine different puzzles. Can you put them together to form a new puzzle that has a solution?

Rules:

-Ordinary Sudoku rules apply

-Thermometer rules apply--digits must increase starting from the bulb end of the thermometer

-Little Killer rules apply--digits along the indicated diagonal must sum to the given value and may repeat

-Killer Sudoku rules apply--digits in the cages must sum to the value indicated and may NOT repeat (The digit in the cage is a 13)

-XV Sudoku rules apply--Pairs of cells marked with an X must sum to 10. Pairs of cells marked with a V must sum to 5

Arrow sudoku rules apply--The digits along the arrow sum to the number in the indicated circle.

-Kropki Sudoku rules apply--Cells separated by a black dot must have a quotient of 2. Cells separated by an empty dot must have a difference of 1.

-Sandwich Sudoku rules apply--Numbers outside the grid indicate the sum of the digits between the 1 and the 9 in the indicated row or column. (In this case, the zero is very circular ;)

-Inequality rules apply--The inequality symbol shows which digit is greater.

Additional notes: Note that there are two given digits. One of them is a 1. Additionally, pieces can be rotated, but cannot be flipped upside-down.
