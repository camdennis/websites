<div style="font-size:16px">
This magenta box is a 4x4 magic square that has been tilted 45 degrees. This magic square must contain the numbers 1 through 16 exactly once and each row, column, and main diagonal of the magenta box must have the same sum. Any number in the magic square that has two digits must be entered as the sum of it's digits. For example, one of the 5's in the magenta box must actually be a 14. Beyond this, regular sudoku rules apply. Have fun!
