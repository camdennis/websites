<p> This puzzle is very clearly inspired by Mitchell Lee's famous Miracle Sudoku and is a bit of low hanging fruit.</p>
<p> The rules are the same as the miracle sudoku rules: Cells separated by a King's move or a Knight's move cannot contain the same digit. Orthogonally adjacent cells cannot contain consecutive digits. The gray regions are clones of one another. </p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
