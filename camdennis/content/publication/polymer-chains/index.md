## Abstract

In this methods paper, I show how one can find and study the physical properties of packings of flexible chains, rigid molecules, and everything in between. In addition to describing the energy landscape of these materials, these methods describe how to shear stabilize polymer packings, classify them in the jamming hierarchy, describe their elastic properties, and much more. This simple modification to soft sphere simulations has the potential to yield new discoveries surrounding glasses. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
