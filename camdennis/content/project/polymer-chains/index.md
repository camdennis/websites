## Abstract

This methods paper presents an extension of the soft sphere model to linked spheres, facilitating the study of packings of semi-flexible soft polymer chains. The approach enables analysis of the physical properties of materials ranging from flexible chains to rigid molecules. Key methodologies include shear stabilization of polymer packings, classification within the jamming hierarchy, and evaluation of elastic properties. This framework aims to deepen understanding of the energy landscapes in amorphous materials, potentially leading to new discoveries in glass physics.

## Key Methods

- **Shear Stabilization**: Techniques to maintain mechanical stability in polymer packings under shear deformations.

- **Jamming Hierarchy Classification**: Methods to categorize packings based on their mechanical and structural properties within the context of jamming theory.

- **Elastic Property Evaluation**: Procedures to assess the linear elastic response of polymer packings, providing insights into their mechanical behavior.
