## Abstract

This research explores how periodic tiling influences the mechanical properties of disordered solids. We demonstrate that introducing periodic boundary conditions can lead to the emergence of zero-frequency modes, affecting the material's rigidity and stability.

## Key Findings

- **Zero-Frequency Modes**: Periodic tiling can induce modes that compromise the rigidity of disordered structures.

- **Implications for Material Design**: Understanding these effects is crucial for designing materials with desired mechanical properties, especially in applications requiring specific rigidity characteristics.
