## Abstract

In this study, we investigate the material properties of hyperuniform jammed sphere packings. Our findings reveal that these packings exhibit anomalous characteristics, distinguishing them from typical disordered systems.

## Key Findings

- **Anomalous Density Fluctuations**: Hyperuniform packings show suppressed density fluctuations at large scales, leading to unique mechanical properties.

- **Mechanical Stability**: Despite their disordered nature, these packings demonstrate mechanical stability comparable to crystalline structures.
