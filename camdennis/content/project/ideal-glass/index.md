## Abstract

We present a method for constructing ideal jammed packings of soft spheres in two dimensions, effectively realizing the zero-temperature ideal glass. These configurations exhibit high bulk and shear moduli, anomalously high density, and hyperuniformity, providing insights into the nature of two-dimensional jammed and glassy systems.

## Key Findings

- **High Moduli and Density**: The constructed packings have elevated bulk and shear moduli and higher densities compared to typical amorphous materials.

- **Hyperuniformity**: These configurations display suppressed density fluctuations, characteristic of hyperuniform systems.

- **Implications for Glassy Systems**: Our methodology offers a pathway to generate well-equilibrated glassy systems, facilitating comprehensive exploration of their properties.
