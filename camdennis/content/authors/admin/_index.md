Cam Dennis is a postdoc currently working at the University of Pennsylvania under the advisement of Andrea Liu and Lisa Manning at Syracuse University.
Cam spends much of his time persuing projects and research
directions in the field non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The idea of cracking the
glass problem is at the root of most of his research endeavors and he boasts progress in meeting that goal.

When he is not working on research puzzles, Cam enjoys solving and creating puzzles, such as Sudoku, for leisure.
He is also an aquarist and avid rock climbing enthusiast.
