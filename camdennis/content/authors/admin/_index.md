## About

I am a physicist and computational modeler with expertise in **quantitative modeling, machine learning, and financial risk analysis**. My background spans **statistical physics, stochastic processes, and complex systems**, with extensive experience in **high-performance computing (HPC), CUDA, and Python-based modeling**.

I am actively seeking roles in **quantitative finance, data science, or academia**, where I can leverage my expertise in modeling, statistical analysis, and programming to drive impactful solutions.

## Experience & Expertise
- **Quantitative Research:** Developing models for financial risk, market behavior, and algorithmic trading.
- **Data Science & Machine Learning:** Applying Bayesian inference, generative models, and predictive analytics.
- **Computational Physics:** Designing simulations for disordered materials and large-scale dynamical systems.
- **Mentorship & Teaching:** Experienced in guiding junior scientists and leading interdisciplinary collaborations.

## Research & Publications
I have published in top-tier journals, including **Physical Review Letters** and **Physical Review E**, on topics ranging from **energy landscapes in jammed systems** to **machine-learned softness in granular materials**.
